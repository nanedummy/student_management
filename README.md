|------|----------|----------|
| Admin | `admin` | `admin123` |
| Faculty | Sent via email on creation | Auto-generated |
| Student | Register number | Set by admin |

---

## Faculty Login Flow

1. Admin adds faculty → system auto-generates username (`firstname.lastname`) and strong password
2. Credentials are sent to faculty's registered email
3. Faculty logs in using **Faculty** tab with username + password
4. Faculty is redirected to their profile showing only their department's students

---

## Student Fee Payment Flow

1. Student logs in → goes to **My Profile** → **Fees** tab
2. Clicks **View Fee Details** → sees fee structure for their course
3. Selects a fee type → enters payment mode + transaction ID
4. Clicks **Pay** → fee recorded in backend
5. Downloads PDF receipt
6. Admin can see the payment in **Fees** and **Payment History**

---

## Seeded Data
